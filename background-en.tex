\section{Background}
First, we consider a POMDP environment in which a single agent acts.
POMDP environment is a 7-tuple $(\S, \A, \Trans, \R, \Observations, \ObProb, \gamma)$,
where $\S$ is a set of states, $\A$ is a set of actions, $\Trans$ is a transitive probability, 
$\Observations$ is a possible set of observation, $\ObProb$ is a set of observation probability, and
$\gamma$ is discount rate.
An agent predicts partially state $h \in \S$ through an observation $s \in \Observations$.
Generally, $s$ has higher dimension than $h$, and is complex.
For example, although Atari 2600 has a read only memory (RAM) as the true state, which contains 128 bytes,
the generated image from that $s$ has more than 10,000 dimension.
Hence, DQN and DRQN abstracts $s$, and creates original state representation to predict good action efficiently.
(although the original paper of DQN assumes MDP, the paper of DRQN pointed out that the environment is POMDP).
Though DQN does not address the state transition directly because it is model-free method, 
some interpretation holds that the hidden state representation is learned in the previous layer of the output layer \citep{zahavy2016graying}
In the method below, we assume that the agent decides the action through a neural network.

TODO: POSG

The design of NaaA is inspired by neuroscience.
A neuron in a neurocircuit consumes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supplied from connected astrocytes.
The astrocyte is a glia cell, which forms structure of a brain, and it supplies fuel from vessel.
As the amount of ATP is limited, the discarded neuron will become extinct with executing apoptosis.
As aspotosis of a neuron is restrained by neurotorophin (NTF) such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
The neuron which can obtain a lot of NTF will live.
The perspective to interpret a neuron as an independent living object is kwown as neural Darwinism \citep{edelman1987neural}.
