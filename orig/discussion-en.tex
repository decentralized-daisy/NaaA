\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Disadvantage}
The one of disadvantage is computational complexity.
As envy-free auction uses sort operation for computing demand,
several part should be serialized.
It should be improved with Approximation.

For optimization method,
although envy-free auction guarantees truthfulness if the prices of buyer are sealed,
in the case which buyer can communicate each other and shares price information, 
the buyer can fake the price with lower demand in collusion.
For the issue, several solution such as random sample auction \cite{goldberg2006competitive} is proposesd.

Adoptive dropconnect has difficulty for implementation for several neural network.
Although, we published source code on GitHub for Linear and CNN, 
implementation for RNN is a future work.

\subsection{Application}
NaaA can be applied on learning distributed environment on computer network such as peer-to-peer network, and controlling sub-module of robot such as multiple camera.
Specifically, it can be applied to various method as below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Hyperparameter tuning. 
Several algorihtm are already proposed such as neuroevolution using genetic algorithm.
In the case, profit or counterfactual return can be used to fitness function.

\item Pruning. Reducing computing cost with downsizing neural network.
\item Attention control. In a part of research of attention, they are using reinforcement learning to control attention.
\item Ensamble. Our method can be applied to mix multiple models.
\end{itemize}
These application is direction of the research.
