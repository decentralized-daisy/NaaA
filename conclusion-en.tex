\section{Conclusion and Future Works}
This paper proposed NaaA, a reinforcement learning framework which treats each units on a neural network as an agent.
First, we pointed out there are dilemma problem if we naively optimize NaaA, and
proposed the optimization method with auction.
As the result, the action which the units evaluates counterfactual return of other units is obtained as Nash equilibrium.
Besides, we proposed $Q$-learning based algorithm, adaptive dropconnect, to dynamically optimizing the topology of neural network with evaluating counterfactual return.
In the evaluation, we performed experiments based on single- and multi-agent platforms, and showed our experimental result improves existing methods.

As future direction, we use on-policy method to perform adaptive dropconnect, and
considering application combining genetic algorithm.
